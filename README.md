# PDF to Text Converter App

This project is a versatile and robust app for converting PDF documents to text, with future plans to include various PDF editing functions. The goal is to launch a startup and make this app widely available, including on the App Store.

## Vision and Future Plans
Our vision is to create a comprehensive PDF editing tool that simplifies the process of managing PDFs. Features we plan to add in the future include:
- Merge and split PDFs
- Annotate and highlight text
- Redact sensitive information
- Fill and sign forms
- Cloud integration for easy access and storage

## Market Analysis
The market for PDF tools is growing as businesses and individuals increasingly rely on digital documents. By offering an all-in-one solution, we aim to capture a significant share of this market.

## Business Model
We plan to adopt a freemium model where basic features are free, and advanced features are available through a subscription. This ensures accessibility while generating sustainable revenue.

## Team
Our team consists of experienced software developers and business strategists dedicated to delivering a high-quality product.
